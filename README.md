# JDayUSA 2024 - Unlock the Power of Joomla! 5: Develop Your First Component with Web Services!

This repository stores the code of my session at JoomlaDay USA 2024 titled: **Unlock the Power of Joomla! 5: Develop Your First Component with Web Services!**.
In this session I showed how to build a Joomla! Component and how easy it is to add Web Services to a well structured component.

This session followed the structure of my book *[Developing Extensions for Joomla! 5](https://developingextensionsforjoomla5.com/?utm_source=gh-jdu24)* and is published at [JoomlaDay USA website](https://jdayusa.com/sessions/sessions-2024/session-2024/april-12-24/slot-2024-04-12-7/unlock-the-power-of-joomla-5-develop-your-first-component-with-web-services).

## How to use this repository

The repository is structure by tags following the different steps of my session:

- *1-bootstraping* : This is the minimum code to have an installable component that shows content on the backend.
- *2-listview* : This iteration shows the data of the list view.
- *3-editview*: This iteration adds a way to create, read and update elements.
- *4-webservices-plugin*: This iteration adds a *webservice* type plugin that routes our extension. It uses the new Joomla 5 architecture. 
- *5-api*: This iteration adds the minimum code to create the Web Service logic.
